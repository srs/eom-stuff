Elasticsearch Oslo Meetup Stuff
===============================

This repository contains files that I use for Elasticsearch Oslo Meetup group
(http://www.meetup.com/elasticsearch-oslo).

Logo
----

Every meetup needs a logo. Since we are all about non-profit we had to create
the logo ourself. I created this logo a saturday evening when the kids was
playing Minecraft. It illustrates the bridge between Elasticsearch (in green),
Oslo (capital of Norway - in blue) and the Meetup (official red color).

Here's the logo files:

* [Logo in PNG](logo/logo.png)
* [Logo in SVG](logo/logo.svg)
* [Text Logo in PNG](logo/logo-text.png)
* [Text Logo in SVG](logo/logo-text.svg)

Here's how the logo looks like:

Also, a "text" version here:
